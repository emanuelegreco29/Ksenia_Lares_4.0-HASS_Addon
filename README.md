This **unofficial** integration allows you to connect your HomeAssistant to the [Ksenia Lares 4.0](https://www.kseniasecurity.com/en/insights/control-panel-ksenia-lares-4-0-the-most-complete-iot-platform-for-home-automation.html) control panel and add all your devices. I am **NOT** affiliated with Ksenia in any way, this integration was made for personal use only.

## Installation
### 1. HACS installation (best method)
1. Make sure you have installed HACS to Home Assistant: [HACS install guide](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download).
2. Open HACS, click **Custom repositories** in the top-right menu, Repository input: `https://github.com/emanuelegreco29/Ksenia_Lares_4.0-HASS_Addon`, Category select **Integration**.

3. **Restart Home Assistant**.
4. You can now search for `Ksenia Lares 4.0` in HACS and install through there.

### 2. Manual installation
To install, simply clone this repository or download it locally. Then, add the `ksenia_lares` folder to your `custom_components` folder and restart HomeAssistant.
Proceed to add the integration as you would with any other integration.

## Setup

When prompted, insert:
- The (local) IP address of your Ksenia Control Panel
- The user PIN to access the Ksenia Control Panel. I highly encourage you to use a user PIN, **without admin permissions** and (if you wish) without access to the home security system
- Check the "SSL" box if you want HomeAssistant to communicate using a **secure connection**. In case of network error, and only in that case, un-check the box
- Check all the devices that you want to add to HomeAssistant (by default, the integration will scan for all compatible devices)

Big thanks to [@gvisconti1983](https://github.com/gvisconti1983) for the crc functions and to [@realnot16](https://github.com/realnot16) for the WebSocket library, which has been reworked and updated by me.
